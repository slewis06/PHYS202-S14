The driver should explain to the navigator the basics of how their program works. Work together to add some error handling to the program. Include a markdown cell identifying the driver and navigator. When you are done, switch roles and let the navigator be the driver and vice versa. At the end you should both have a Battleship program that includes some error handling."
